# Celestial Angles Analysis

This project analyzes celestial angles and identifies photogenic moments in space. It uses Python and requires installation of specific packages. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the project locally on both Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You also need the following packages:

- `spiceypy`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these packages using `pip`, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyter spiceypy numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open a web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

4. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the `planets_in_the_sky.ipynb` notebook.

5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells and analyze the celestial angles.

6. The resulting plot will be displayed within the notebook.

## Operating System-Specific Instructions
